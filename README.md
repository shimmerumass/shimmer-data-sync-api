## Key Features

### Data Management
- Upload Shimmer sensor files (.txt) to S3
- Automatic filename parsing (device, timestamp, experiment, shimmer device)
- Patient-device mapping with DynamoDB
- Batch file downloads (by day, by user/date)
- Generate presigned upload/download URLs

### Sensor Data Processing
- Binary sensor data decoding (Shimmer3 format)
  - 256-byte header: device info, sample rate, enabled sensors, calibration parameters
  - Variable-length data packets (3-byte timestamp + sensor channels)
- Multi-channel support with raw and calibrated data:
  - Accel_LN (Low-Noise Accelerometer): X, Y, Z axes
  - Accel_WR (Wide-Range Accelerometer): X, Y, Z axes
  - Gyro (Gyroscope): X, Y, Z axes
  - Mag (Magnetometer): X, Y, Z axes
  - Each channel provides both raw and calibrated (_cal) values
- Inertial sensor calibration
  - Offset correction, gain scaling, alignment matrix (applied to all inertial sensors)
- Time synchronization with phone RTC and rollover correction
  - Initial RTC sync from phone timestamp (Unix epoch)
  - Output: Unix timestamps in `timestampCal`, ISO 8601 in `timestampReadable`
- Computed metrics:
  - `Accel_WR_Absolute`: Magnitude (√(x² + y² + z²)) for each sample
  - `Accel_WR_VAR`: Range (max - min) of absolute acceleration
    - UWB distance (`uwbDis`): Ultra-wideband distance readings (float, meters or device units)
    - `uwbDis`: List of UWB distance readings per sample (if available)

### Smart Storage
- Full decoded data → S3 as JSON (handles 60k+ samples)
- Summary metrics only → DynamoDB (stays under 400KB limit)
- Scalable architecture for large sensor datasets

### Flexible Time-Based Grouping for Shimmer Data
- Decoded records are grouped by device and patient, then split into groups where all records are within a tunable time window (default: 15 seconds) of each other, regardless of date boundaries.
- Each group is assigned a unique `group_id` (e.g., `group1`, `group2`, ...) based on the earliest timestamp in the group.
- Shimmer assignment: Within each group, decoded data is assigned to `shimmer1_decoded` or `shimmer2_decoded` based on the device mapping from DynamoDB, not just by order or presence.
- Single-shimmer groups: If only one shimmer is present in a group, it is still assigned to the correct field based on the mapping, and the other field is left empty.
- This grouping approach ensures all records within a group are temporally close (within 15 seconds), supporting flexible analysis and robust downstream processing. Grouping is based on time proximity, not by calendar date.
- When combining files, shimmer assignment is always determined by looking up the device's mapping in DynamoDB (device-patient map). The system does not assign by order or filename, but uses the mapping to ensure each decoded record is placed in the correct field (`shimmer1_decoded` or `shimmer2_decoded`).

### Calibration and Decoding Script Improvements
- The calibration and decoding script (`shimmerCalibrate.py`) is a direct Python port of the MATLAB function, with robust handling for:
  - Binary decoding of Shimmer3 files, including dynamic channel parsing and custom 24-bit signed integer support.
  - Inertial sensor calibration (offset, gain, alignment) for all axes and sensor types.
  - Time calibration with rollover correction and smoothing, outputting both Unix and ISO 8601 timestamps.
  - Output file naming now preserves the original base name for both `.mat` and `.json` files.
  - All array math is implemented using standard Python (no NumPy required).
  - Optional plotting and MATLAB file export if dependencies are available.

</p>

**User → API → AWS Pipeline**

- Researchers upload Shimmer sensor `.txt` files via REST API.

**FastAPI + Mangum (Lambda)**
- Entry point that handles routing, upload, decode requests, and DynamoDB/S3 interactions.

**Shimmer Decoder (`shimmerCalibrate.py`)**
- Parses binary stream → applies calibration → generates calibrated data.

**AWS S3**
- Stores raw uploaded files.
- Stores full decoded JSON (large datasets).

**AWS DynamoDB**
- Stores file metadata and summary metrics.
- Maintains device–patient mappings.

**Retrieval Layer**
- Allows fetching summarized data quickly or full decoded datasets from S3 when needed.

## Setup

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install fastapi uvicorn boto3 python-dotenv mangum pydantic
   ```

2. Configure environment variables (`.env`):
   ```env
   S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   DDB_TABLE=your-device-patient-db
   DDB_FILE_TABLE=your-file-db
   AWS_REGION=your-region
   ```

## Architecture Notes

### DynamoDB Size Limit Solution
Shimmer files can contain 60,000+ samples, making arrays too large for DynamoDB's 400KB item limit. Our solution:

1. **Full decoded data** → Stored in S3 at `decoded/{filename}.json`
2. **Summary metrics** → Stored in DynamoDB (num_samples, accel_wr_var, etc.)
3. **Reference link** → DynamoDB item includes `decoded_s3_key` for full data retrieval
4. **Recording timestamp** → DynamoDB includes `recordedTimestamp` field with human-readable ISO format timestamp (e.g., `2024-09-24T22:38:36+00:00`)
   - Shimmer files store timestamps as Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) in the `timestampCal` array
   - The first value from `timestampCal[0]` is extracted and converted from Unix format to ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone
   - This provides quick access to recording start time without fetching the full 60k-sample timestamp array from S3

  **Note:** The `recordedTimestamp` is rounded down to the nearest lower 10-second boundary (e.g., 39 and 32 become 30) for consistency in metadata. The original `timestampCal` array in the decoded data is not modified and retains its full precision.

This keeps DynamoDB items small (~2-5 KB) while preserving full data access via S3 and providing quick access to key metadata like recording start time.

- **Flexible Time-Based Grouping for Shimmer Data:**
  - Decoded records are grouped by device and patient, and then split into groups where all records are within a tunable time window (default: 15 seconds) of each other, regardless of date boundaries.
  - Each group is assigned a unique `group_id` (e.g., `group1`, `group2`, ...) based on the earliest timestamp in the group.
  - This allows for robust handling of recordings that are close in time but not exactly synchronized, and supports both single- and dual-shimmer scenarios. Grouping is not strictly by date, but by temporal proximity.
